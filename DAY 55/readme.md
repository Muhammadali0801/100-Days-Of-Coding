🗃 Understanding Data Types in JavaScript
Think of data types as different kinds of containers for information. Just as you use different boxes to store toys, books, and clothes, data types in programming hold specific kinds of information.

Here are the basic data types in JavaScript:

String: Textual data (e.g., "Hello, World!")
Number: Numeric data (e.g., 42, 3.14)
Boolean: True or false values (e.g., true, false)
Object: Key-value pairs for more complex data structures
Array: Ordered list of values
Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value
Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value
