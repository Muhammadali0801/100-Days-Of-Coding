/* Engaging with users through web interaction is crucial for creating dynamic and responsive web applications.
 JavaScript provides several methods to interact with users:*/

//alert(): Display a simple message to the user.

alert("Hello, World!");

// prompt(): Collect input from the user.

let name1 = prompt("What is your name?");
console.log(name1);

//confirm(): Ask the user to confirm an action.

let isConfirmed = confirm("Are you sure?");
console.log(isConfirmed);

/*ðŸ—ƒ Understanding Data Types in JavaScript
Think of data types as different kinds of containers for information. Just as you use different boxes to store toys,
 books, and clothes, data types in programming hold specific kinds of information.*/

 /*String: Textual data (e.g., "Hello, World!")
Number: Numeric data (e.g., 42, 3.14)
Boolean: True or false values (e.g., true, false)
Object: Key-value pairs for more complex data structures*/
let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25
};
